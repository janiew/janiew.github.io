            <p>Hi! I am a programmer, game designer, and writer based in Ithaca, NY. I currently am a senior at Cornell University, where I am majoring in Computer Science as well as Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies.
            Out of class I design tabletop roleplaying games and write everything from poetry to games crit.</p>

            <p>
                I am a skilled and agile UI/UX programmer, with experience working on AAA games as well as web design and development. 
                I excel at figuring out new systems quickly and cherish chances to learn new skills and push my own boundaries.

            <p>
                I am a professional tabletop roleplaying game designer, publishing games on <a href="https://janiejw.itch.io/">itch.io</a>. 
                As a designer, I am interested in expressing ideas of queerness and embodiment through my writing. 
                I also love to explore new patterns of play and find new ways of interacting with other players and games themselves.
            </p>
